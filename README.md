# Neuroset EEG Treatment Simulator with QT6 c++
#### Description: 
This project implements a Neuroset EEG Treatment Device Simulator using QT6 and C++. The simulator provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to mimic the functionality of a real Neuroset device.

#### Features:
- GUI: Displays device status, flashing session light indicators, and battery status.
- Neuroset Device: Simulates the core device functionality; Run treatment sessions, View session logs, change the date and time.
- Headset: Represents the connected headset, indicating connection status and supporting a demo for loosing and regaining connection to the headset.
- PC: Simulates a connected PC, providing options to get session baseline frequencies and charge the device battery.
- Amplitude Graph: Displays a real-time simulated EEG signal amplitude over time.

#### Technologies:
QT6: Cross-platform GUI framework for building the user interface.

C++: Programming language for implementing simulator logic.
